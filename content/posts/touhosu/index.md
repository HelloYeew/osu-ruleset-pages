Touhosu is a custom osu! ruleset based on [Touhou Project games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project#Games). The ruleset is developed by Evast and is only available at Evast's Patreon page

# gameplay

The player controls a character (the character visual is [Reimu Hakurei](https://touhou.fandom.com/wiki/Reimu_Hakurei), the main character of Touhou Project), escaping from enemies' bullets spawns to the rhythm. The character's lives will gradually regen. When hit by a bullet, the character loses a live. The player is able to shoot enemies, but given the lack of enemies, it is pretty much useless. `Focus` mode can be used in order to slow down player movement.

<!-- TODO: Make sure more about focus control. -->
