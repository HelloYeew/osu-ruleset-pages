Touhosu is a custom osu! ruleset based on [Touhou Project game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project#Games). The ruleset is developed by Evast. This ruleset only available at Evast's Patreon page.

# gameplay

Player control a character (a character is [Reimu Hakurei](https://touhou.fandom.com/wiki/Reimu_Hakurei), main character of Touhou Project) to escape from a bullet from enemies that coming fall along with a rhythm. A character's live will gradually regen. If a character hit by a bullet, a character losts a live.
