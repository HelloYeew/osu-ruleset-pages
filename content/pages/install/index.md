# import rulesets to osu!lazer

### Step 1 : Navigate to osu! data directory

Open the setting menu in osu!, in `General` part there would be a button to `Open osu! folder`. On windows you could navigate to the data folder directly via Windows Explorer, by default this location is `%AppData%/osu!/rulesets`. On MacOS default this location is in application itself.

Other rulesets also could share the same folder.

### Stpe 3: Have fun!

After completing the above steps. If you already open osu!lazer during install you may need to restart osu!lazer. Once osu!lazer is started, you should see the ruleset alongside the standard rulesets.
