# Rūrusetto (ルールセット)

A wiki that contain all osu! rulesets

## About the new website

The new website is target to revamp all UI of the website and make Rūrusetto not a static website anymore with a lot of new function that cannot add in old website source code.

You can test on the new website [here](https://beta.rulesets.info) and you can see changelog in website or GitHub release.

## Old website source code

An old source code of the website is in [the other branch](https://github.com/Rurusetto/rurusetto/tree/main)

The main website will use the old source code until I am sure that the new code can be used now.

About question on new website I already write an explanation on [this](https://github.com/Rurusetto/rurusetto/tree/main#a-big-update-of-r%C5%ABrusetto).
